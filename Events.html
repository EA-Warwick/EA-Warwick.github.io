								<h2>Our Fellowships</h2>
								<p>Our intro fellowship is the perfect one stop shop for those new to Effective Altruism. Each week of the term we meet and discuss a new topic relevant to Effective Altruism, from long-termist thinking to the future of AI. There is an outline syllabus containing some readings we would reccomend you do before each session but these don't take too long, since we know you'll likely be busy with university work.</p>
								<p>Alongside the intro fellowship we run an adnvanced fellowship in the same format for veteran effective altruists along with an AI safety reading group and a rationality reading group for deep dives into specific topics.</p>

								<h2>Talks</h2>
								<p>We run a number of talks in various areas, these are held on campus, and are usually given by academics/career professionals in the area. We aim to make the talks as accesible as possible to those studying related degrees as well as those completely new to the topics, and there is of course (usually) some free food to have.
								To see a list of topics we hold regular talks on, see our topics of interest page, and to find a specific room, see the interactive campus map.

								<h2>Coworking & socials</h2>
								<p>In addition to all our EA related activities, we regularly run socials and laid back gatherings since we are also a community of people. Our coworking sessions are held weekly and details on exactly when and where can be found in our calendar
									. Coworking is an opportunity to catch up with others, bring some work, or just chill for an hour every week. In addition to coworking, we sporadically run wellbeing related events, such as runs, walks, coffee mornings and so forth, these are oppotunities to 
									come have a chat or get away from work for a while, we hope to see you there!
								</p>
							</section>
							<section id="hackathon" class="main special">
								<h2>Hackathons and careers</h2>
								<p> We also occasionally participate in hackathons as a team, which usually entails working in a room on campus over the weekend. These usually don't require any advanced coding knowledge, and there are always plenty of people present to help you out if you're unsure of anything during the hackathon. 
									<br>
									These can be great for a CV, as passion projects, or just social activities, we encourage you to come along to find out more about the increasing relevant fields of AI and machine learning as part of our community!<br>
									In addition to these hackathons, there is a wide network of people from the center for effective altruism (and in our own exec) who can help you find out what a job relevant to EA can look like for you, or simply provide some more details, feel free to reach out via our various social media, or our
